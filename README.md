# Find-Mouse-Cordinates
This code uses the pyautogui module to display the coordinates of the mouse pointer. The time.sleep() function is used to introduce a pause in the script for 3 seconds to allow the user to position the mouse.

The pyautogui.position() function returns the current (x, y) coordinates of the mouse pointer as a Point object. These coordinates are printed to the console using the print() function.

Overall, this code allows the user to determine the current position of the mouse on the screen.
